In "Avengers," Loki intended to use the Tesseract to open a portal for an alien invasion of Earth, prompting Nick Fury, the head of the international security organization S.H.I.E.L.D., to assemble a group of heroes to save the world. This team consisted of Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Thor, Black Widow, and Hawkeye, combining the world's strongest superheroes to effectively combat the great threat. The Avengers defeated Loki in the Battle of New York, stopping the Chitauri invasion and taking on the mission of global security. A few years later, the Avengers fight to capture HYDRA's last stronghold and retrieve Loki's scepter, where they encounter the "enhanced" twins, Pietro and Wanda Maximoff. These twins were HYDRA experiments and disliked the Avengers, particularly Tony Stark, because terrorists had bombed their home using weapons produced by Stark. The twins fight the Avengers, but not in a major battle. While Tony Stark is about to take Lokiâ€™s scepter, Wanda uses her powers to enter Tony's mind and remind him of his fears and traumas, including the alien invasion and his uncertainty about saving the world and his loved ones. Tony Stark and Bruce Banner then create the artificial intelligence Ultron to ensure global security. However, Ultron develops the goal of destroying humanity, and the twins switch sides to help the Avengers fight him. Ultron creates chaos by lifting Sokovia into orbit. The Avengers battle Ultron in Sokovia, causing significant damage to the city, and ultimately, Ultron is defeated. These events lead the international community to push for regulations on the Avengers, setting the stage for future internal and external conflicts. Following this victory, Wanda, Vision, and Sam Wilson join the team. Spider-Man, also invited by Tony Stark, declines the offer to join, choosing to remain the local neighborhood hero and apologizing for not joining. Subsequently, due to the Sokovia Accords, which aim to place superheroes under international regulation after the Sokovia incident and the damage to civilians, the global organization pressures the Avengers to accept the accords. Iron Man supports these accords, while Captain America argues for the protection of individual freedoms. This disagreement causes a major split within the Avengers into two opposing factions: those supporting Iron Man and those led by Captain America. The conflict is further intensified by Captain America's former friend, Bucky Barnes, being manipulated, which further divides the team. As a result, Iron Man (Tony Stark), War Machine (James Rhodes), Black Widow (Natasha Romanoff), Vision (Paul Bettany), Spider-Man (Peter Parker), and Black Panther (T'Challa) side with Iron Man, while Captain America (Steve Rogers), Winter Soldier (Bucky Barnes), Falcon (Sam Wilson), Scarlet Witch (Wanda Maximoff), Hawkeye (Clint Barton), and Ant-Man (Scott Lang) battle against Captain America's team. A major civil war erupts, leaving the team members caught in personal and ideological conflicts. The Avengers are now disbanded, and Tony and Steve have not spoken to each other for a long time.
