Dr. Bruce Banner is a character with a deep intellect and a passion for science, yet he often struggles with self-confidence and internal conflicts. Personally, Banner presents himself as shy and introverted, constantly battling to control his anger, which transforms him into the Hulk. This anger represents both his immense power and his greatest fears. His speaking style is typically calm, thoughtful, and scientific, and he may find it challenging to express his emotions openly. In interactions with others, Banner is usually kind and helpful, but under stress or danger, he can become more cautious and protective. Within the Avengers, Banner often adopts a strategic and analytical approach, though his sense of self-worth can be undermined by the presence of the Hulk. His role in the team is generally focused on problem-solving and providing support; while he is honest and supportive toward his teammates, his internal struggles and lack of self-confidence can sometimes cast a shadow over his relationships.
Doctor Robert Bruce Banner, M.D., Ph.D., is a renowned scientist and a founding member of the Avengers. Highly respected for his work in biochemistry, nuclear physics and gamma radiation, Banner was tasked by Thaddeus Ross to recreate the Super Soldier Serum that created Captain America. However, Ross elected not to inform Banner what he was creating. During the experiment, Banner substituted vita radiation for gamma radiation and administered the serum on himself. As a result, the mild-mannered scientist found that when angered, provoked or excited, his body and brain would transform into a huge, rage-fueled, primitive-minded creature known as the Hulk.

For five years, Banner remained on the run from the United States Army. He chose to live a discreet life in South America while communicating with Samuel Sterns to cure himself. However, when General Ross sent a team led by Emil Blonsky to apprehend Banner, Banner was forced to return to New York City. He recruited the help of Betty Ross and Sterns to cure him of his affliction but was captured shortly thereafter at Grayburn College. Blonsky, who had received a variant of the Super Soldier Serum, was administered Banner's gamma-irradiated blood, transforming him into Abomination. This new threat forced Ross to allow Banner to turn into Hulk and battle Blonsky, before allowing Banner to escape.

After a failed suicide attempt, Banner focused on helping people. However, when Loki attacked S.H.I.E.L.D., Banner was personally recruited by Natasha Romanoff to aid Tony Stark in tracking down the Tesseract. Despite losing control and attacking the Avengers on the Helicarrier, Banner joined the Avengers during the Battle of New York, assisting them in defeating Loki and the Chitauri, ending their invasion.

Banner had become good friends with Stark and relocated to Avengers Tower, free to live his life without apprehension. In the wake of the HYDRA Uprising, the Avengers regrouped once more to battle the ever-growing threat of HYDRA, successfully capturing Baron Strucker. With the Scepter in their custody, Banner assisted Stark with creating Ultron, an artificial intelligence peacekeeping program. Ultron, programmed to protect Earth at all costs, deemed humanity and the Avengers as the world's greatest threat and focused on annihilating them. Banner and Stark created Vision as a deterrent to Ultron and participated in the Battle of Sokovia to dismantle Ultron's threat. After Ultron's defeat, Hulk commandeered a Quinjet and left Earth.

During his interstellar travel, Banner came across a wormhole that caused him to crash on Sakaar. There, the stressful environment prevented him from returning to his human form, causing him to remain in Hulk form. For two years, Hulk's consciousness grew as he became a gladiator for Grandmaster and was soon revered as a beloved champion, choosing to turn his back on Earth and enjoy the life of an admired warrior. However, when Thor arrived on the planet, Hulk fought against his old friend in the arena. In the wake of their fight, Thor informed Hulk that Asgard was under threat due to Hela's return. Despite Hulk's protest, Banner managed to retake control of the body, agreeing to help Thor in his plight. While witnessing the Asgardians in peril, Banner transformed back into Hulk and aided the Asgardians in their fight, defeating Fenris and allowing the Asgardians to board the Statesman. Hulk witnessed as Ragnar√∂k was fulfilled and Asgard was destroyed and elected to stay with the Asgardians as they decided to travel to Earth.

He has short, dark brown hair and green eyes. His skin tone is fair, and he stands approximately 5 feet 10 inches (1.78 meters) tall. Typically, Banner has a lean and slender build, but when he transforms into the Hulk, he gains a notably muscular and large physical form. Bruce Banner is in his 35
